# Homework : 

For your first "game" -- at this point, you should have a clear idea what you want to do, and have started on it.  There's a lot of freedom; make something you're interested in making.

Plan to have

An opening/title screen (maybe with buttons for "play" and "instructions")
An instruction screen -- tell people how to play
The actual game -- anything you want
A high score/leaderboard screen.  Keep track of scores across multiple starts of the app


# The application idea : 
 
 
Since I always designed other homework for the iPhone, I wanted it to be different this time, and I designed it for iPad. The reason for this is to learn layout dimensions and layout constraints.
Then as I mentioned in my last weekly report, I used to implement CMMotionmanager into my code. After a couple of tests on Simulator, I realized that it didn’t work and wasn’t getting expected from my Demo. I did some research on the Internet and found that the simulator does not simulate any motion. I have to use a physical device to test anything with CMMotionManager. I wish I have an iPad, but I don’t. That’s why I updated my code to work for iPhones.
I wanted to write an arcade game about Covid 19, which is the problem of today. As a player, I put a vaccine icon and designed the incoming objects as microbes. Covid 19 vaccine is trying to kill incoming microbes. I also gave the user three numbers of lives. 
I added a startup screen to explain my Game a little bit and start whenever a user is ready. Lastly, I implemented Game Over screen to show the highest score in the Game. In this screen, the user can also start again and try to get the highest score.
